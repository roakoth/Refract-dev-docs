# What is Refract
**Refract** is a JavaScript framework designed to help developers build modern, scalable, and reactive user interfaces. 

It helps developers create scalable, modern UIs by combining familiar ideas from React’s component model with new concepts for reactivity and state management.

The core innovation in Refract is the idea of refractions. A **refraction** is a declarative way to describe how the UI should update in response to state changes and data flows.

If you’ve used React, Svelte, or Solid.js, some concepts will feel familiar. But Refract goes further, with a focus on **clarity**, **performance**, and **developer experience**.

## Key features

- Lightweight compiler – Optimizes components at build time, reducing runtime overhead.
- Stream-based updates – Supports real-time, reactive data streams out of the box.
- Declarative animations – Define transitions and animations directly in your UI code.
- Side-effect control – Effects are opt-in, predictable, and scoped to components.
- Optical composition – Reusable patterns for UI logic, similar to hooks but optimized for reactivity.
- TypeScript and JSX support – First-class integration with TypeScript and JSX-like syntax.
- Refractions and lenses – A simple yet powerful way to manage state and props reactively.

## Why Refract

Building modern web apps often requires developers to juggle performance tuning, state management, and complex boilerplate. Refract simplifies this process.

Refract provides:

- **Clarity** – A clean, declarative model for describing UI behavior.
- **Reactivity** – A lightweight system for keeping state and UI in sync.
- **Performance** – Compiler-level optimizations and efficient runtime updates.
- **Flexibility** – Works with TypeScript, existing tools, and modern workflows.

With Refract, you can focus on building maintainable, intuitive, and high-performance UIs without the overhead of complex patterns or unnecessary abstractions.
