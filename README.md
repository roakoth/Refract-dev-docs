# Refract

*A fictional JavaScript UI framework created to sharpen your technical documentation skills.*

## What is Refract?

Refract is a fictional, React-inspired JavaScript framework designed to give technical writers a playground for building rich and structured documentation. It introduces concepts like **refractions**, **lenses**, and **optics** to simulate a complex, modern front-end library.

This project was created and maintained by the [Technical Writers Mentorship Program (TWMP)](https://github.com/Technical-writing-mentorship-program) to help writers practice real-world documentation workflows.

## Why did we create this project?

Documenting a real-world product often involves:

- Explaining complex concepts clearly
- Writing step-by-step guides for setup and usage
- Structuring information for different personas (beginner, advanced, contributor, etc.)
- Maintaining consistency and clarity across documentation

Refract simulates all of that in one fictional but detailed framework.

## How to use this repo

1. **Understand the project**: Navigate to the [Refract](https://github.com/Technical-writing-mentorship-program/Refract/blob/main/Refract.md) project file to get a good understanding of how this project works.

2. **Fork this repository**: This gives you your own workspace to build documentation.

3. **Document the framework**

4. **Enhance the fictional project (optional, encouraged!)**: You can:
   - Add new APIs
   - Simulate internal logic
   - Create new folders like `plugins/`, `router/`, or `compiler/`

5. **Share your work with the community**: Drop your fork link in the [TWMP community Discord](https://discord.gg/VJxrgpMb) or tag us on social media. We love to see creative spins!

## Core concepts (Brief overview)

| Concept           | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `Refractions`     | Reactive state units similar to signals or stores |
| `Lenses`          | Scope-aware helpers for accessing props, effects, and state |
| `Optics`          | Composable logic units like hooks |
| `Components`      | Pure functions that return UI using JSX-like syntax |
| `Effects`         | Side-effect handlers (`useEffect`, `useFlash`) |
| `createApp()`     | Initializes and mounts the app |
| `createComponent()` | Builds a functional component |

## An example structure you could use:

```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ getting-started.md
â”œâ”€â”€ concepts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ refractions.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lenses.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ optics.md
â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ createComponent.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useRefraction.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useEffect.md
â”œâ”€â”€ tutorials/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ counter-app.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ global-theme.md
â””â”€â”€ contributing.md
```

Don't constrain yourself to this structure. Please be as flexible as possible and rely on diverse SSGs to bring this project to life.

## Tips for writers

- Write as if this project is used by thousands of developers.
- Clarify what problems each concept/API solves.
- Show code examples on every page.
- Structure your docs like a real developer site (e.g. React, Vue, or Svelte).
- You can even create a mock website using tools like [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org), or [Astro](https://astro.build).

## A project by TWMP

This project was created by the [Technical Writers Mentorship Program](https://github.com/Technical-writing-mentorship-program), an open community for mentoring and growing the next generation of technical writers.

We hope Refract gives you the space to explore, create, and get hands-on experience with the art of writing developer documentation.
